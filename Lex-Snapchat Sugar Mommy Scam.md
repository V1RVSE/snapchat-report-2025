## Summary
While browsing a dating app, I was approached by a user claiming to be a "sugar baby" offering to refer to me to her "sugar mommy." The interaction shifted quickly to another platform, where emotional manipulation and pressure tactics were used to extract personal information.

Recognizing scam indicators, I conducted a small-scale OSINT investigation to safely gather evidence and document the scam process before reporting it to the FTC and FBI.

## Timeline of Events
- April 28, 2025: Initial approach on a dating platform by an account offering sugar arrangements.
- April 29, 2025: Conversation migrated to a messaging app. The new account appeared coordinated with the first. 
- April 29â€“May 2, 2025: I maintained communication to document tactics while withholding personal details.
- May 2, 2025: I was blocked after questioning inconsistencies. Reports were filed with federal authorities.

## Methodology
I applied OSINT fundamentals, including:
- Analyzing profile activity patterns and language use
- Capturing metadata and timestamps from communications
- Reverse searching associated images (where possible)
- Archiving evidence securely and ethically
  
No unauthorized access, impersonation, or invasive techniques were used.

## Outcome and Reflections
### Outcome
- Scam attempt avoided
- Report submitted to the FTC and FBI IC3
- Full Snapchat log not preserved due to account block
- Key artifacts retained (redacted in private copy)

### Reflections
- Missed chance to document **full** Snapchat logs
- Reacted emotionally during some parts 
- Successfully preserved key elements
- Trusting instincts paid off during investigation
